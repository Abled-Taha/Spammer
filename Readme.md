Just install the installer, stand-alone one-file exe or clone this repository.

If you will clone the repository and run it like that than you could encounter some problem with directories.

If you are going to clone the repository and run script then:
	1. Please have the Python Version 3.9 or higher.
	2. Please install all the packages listed in requirements.txt
	3. Make sure you are in the "Scripts" folder before running the script.
	4. And finally run the "MainWindow.py"

Or if you are going to download the stand-alone one-file exe then you may encounter some problems with default bee script spamming.
	
I recommend to download the Setup File.
	
Other Important Info:
	1. You need to open the WhatsApp or any other messenger and select the contact and then click the chat box manually.
	2. You can stop the Spammer by pressing "/" after it starts.
	3. Once started it cannot be stoppped until it starts typing or you close it from Task Manager.
	4. It will send messages automatically after typing.
