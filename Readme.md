Just install the installer, stand-alone one-file exe or clone this repository.

If you will clone the repository and run it like that than you could face some problem with directories.

But if you are going to clone the repo and run script then:
	1. Please have the Python Version 3.9 or higher.
	2. Please install all the packages listed in requirements.txt
	3. Make sure you are in the "Scripts" folder before running the script.
	4. And finally run the "MainWindow.py"

Or if you are not going to download the Setup File and going to downlaod the stand-alone one-file exe then you may encounter some problems with default bee script spamming.
	
Other Important Info:
	1. You need to open the WhatsApp or any messenger and select the contact and then click the chat box manually.
	2. You can stop the Spammer by pressing "/" after it starts.
	3. Once started it cannot be stoppped until it starts typing or you close it from Task Manager.
	4. It will send messages automatically after typing.
	

Note: If it gets out of control then any loss of data, relation or any other thing is not my fault.
